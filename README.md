# The Buddhist Monastic Code
## By Ajahn Geoff

This repository contains the code for downloading
[The Buddhist Monastic Code volumes 1 and 2](https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0001.html)
and rendering each section of the book as a Markdown Note
suitable for use in a notes app such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

This module is meant to work as a part of
[The Vinaya Notebook](https://labs.buddhistuniversity.net/vinaya/)
but could be used standalone with some modifications.
